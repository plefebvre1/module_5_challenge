# Module 5 Challenge

A prototype application for a credit union has been developed in Python to perform two functions:

1. A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

2. A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.7 in Jupyter Lab with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For financial data analysis tools
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - For data visualizations
* [AlpacaSDK](https://alpaca.markets/docs/) - For historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations

## Contributors

Starter code for this app was provided by the GWU Fintech Bootcamp program. Updates to that code to fulfill the analysis were done by Peter Lefebvre (peter.c.lefebvre@gmail.com)
